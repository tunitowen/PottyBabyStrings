Potty Baby is designed to help parents potty train their child.

It will alert you at intervals (defined by yourself) when you child should use the potty. You can also log accidents and naps in the app.

The app keeps a record of all potty activity, accidents and naps so you can see how your child is progressing.

The app requires internet permissions for adverts alone.
